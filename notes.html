            <h2>Observations and Opinions</h2>
            <hr/>

            <p>In procuring all of the weapon sounds for the Halo games, I spent
                more than a few minutes listening to each sound of the game closely
                through headphones. I scrutinized ambient noise levels and peaks
                and reminisced about the first LAN parties with Halo: CE as
                I shot that old Assault Rifle for the first time in years. I thought
                it would be fun to hear how much the weapon sounds had changed
                over the years, but I was suprised at how some sounds hadn't
                changed much at all while others have changed a lot. 
            </p>
            <p>I hope you enjoy listening to these sounds and learning as much
                as I did.</p>

            <h3>What is in this Collection</h3>
            <p>The collection of sounds on this site only includes multiplayer
                weapons that can be obtained through either normal game play
                or through the Forge. The following games are included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Halo: CE</li>
                <li>Halo 2</li>
                <li>Halo 3</li>
                <li>Halo: Reach</li>
                <li>Halo 4</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What isn't in this Collection</h3>
            <p>This collection isn't complete. For example, the Flamethrower
                from Halo 3 isn't included (yet).</p>

            <p>I don't intend to include weapons only available in the campaign
                or in Firefight/Spartan Ops modes.</p>

            <p>Vehicle weapons (e.g. Warthog gauss cannon, Scorpion tank cannon, etc)
                are also not included, although they may be added in the future.</p>

            <h3>General Evolution of Sounds</h3>
            <p>From <em>Halo: CE</em> through <em>Halo: Reach</em>, some original weapons
                did not see significant sound changes. Specifically, the Magnum
                pistol, Plasma Rifle, Plasma Pistol, Sniper Rifle, and Needler all maintain
                their sounds through those games.</p>

            <p>Rounding out the original weapons are the Rocket Launcher, Frag Grenade,
                and Plasma Grenade. These all experienced some significant changes
                in each new game that was released.</p>

            <p>The Spartan Laser, which is not an "original" weapon, seems to have
                the same sound in Halo 3 and Halo: Reach.</p>

            <p>All other weapons are either unique to a single game or experienced
                noticeable changes from game to game.</p>

            <h3>Halo: CE and Halo 2 Notes</h3>

            <p>The big observation with Halo: CE and Halo 2 was how loud the ambient sounds are
                in those games. For this project, I tried to find the quietest map/location
                where I could fire each weapon and record it.</p>
            <p>In CE, there is the
                rushing water of Battle Creek everywhere you go, a cacophony of
                birds and insects in Blood Gulch, or a defeaning bass drone in
                Chill Out (the ambient bass drone on this map is just as loud as
                firing a weapon).</p>
            <p>Halo 2 was challenging because the game audio crackled and got distorted
                regularly. I don't know why that is, but I suspect it may have to
                do with playing an original XBox game on the XBox 360. I tried to
                avoid these situations but you may hear some distortion in some 
                audio clips. Halo 2 also had very loud ambient sounds on most of
                its maps, similar to CE.</p>

            <h3>Halo 3</h3>

            <p>In Halo 3 there was finally a good level difference between the
                ambient sounds in the maps and the weapons. This made capturing
                the sounds much easier.</p>
            <p>Not much else to say about Halo 3, other than the Missle Pod was
                kind of fun to listen to again.</p>

            <h3>Halo: Reach</h3>

            <p>Halo: Reach also had good differentiation between ambient sound and
                the weapons. However, a lot of reverb is noticeable with each
                weapon sound. This may be due to firing the weapons in the
                "Colosseum" area of Forge World. I may attempt to re-record the
                sounds in an outdoor area in Forge World and see if that elimintaes
                the reverb.</p>

            <h3>Halo 4 Overhaul</h3>
            <p>In Halo 4, every weapon sound got a major overhaul. Not only that,
                but the Halo 4 sounds seem crisper and full of sublteties that
                didn't exist in the previous games. The Halo 4 weapons also
                have a <strong>lot</strong> more <em>punch</em>. In Halo 4
                the sounds hit <em>hard</em>! My favorites in Halo 4 include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Sniper Rifle (very hard attack)</li>
                <li>Sticky Detonator (complex sound/weapon with many parts)</li>
                <li>Beam Rifle (sounds like a dubstep synth)</li>
            </ul>
